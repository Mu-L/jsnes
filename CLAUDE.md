# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Essential Commands

- `npm test` - Run code formatting check and tests (required before commits)
- `npm run build` - Build distribution files (`dist/jsnes.js` and `dist/jsnes.min.js`)
- `npm run format` - Auto-format all source code with Prettier
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode for development

## Code Architecture

JSNES is a JavaScript NES emulator with component-based architecture mirroring actual NES hardware:

### Core Components (all in `src/`)

**Main Orchestrator**: `nes.js` - Central class that coordinates all emulation components. Accepts callback functions for frame rendering, audio output, and status updates.

**CPU**: `cpu.js` - Implements 6502 processor with 64KB address space, instruction execution, and interrupt handling (NMI, IRQ, reset).

**PPU**: `ppu.js` - Picture Processing Unit handles 256x240 graphics rendering, VRAM management, background/sprite rendering, and scrolling.

**PAPU**: `papu.js` - Audio Processing Unit implements NES's 5 audio channels (2 square waves, triangle, noise, DMC) with 44.1kHz/48kHz sample generation.

**Memory Mappers**: `mappers.js` - Implements cartridge memory mappers (0-180) using inheritance hierarchy. All mappers inherit from Mapper 0 and override specific banking/memory mapping behavior.

**ROM Loader**: `rom.js` - Parses iNES format ROM files, extracts PRG-ROM/CHR-ROM, and determines appropriate mapper.

### Key Architectural Patterns

- **Event-driven design**: Main NES class uses callbacks (`onFrame`, `onAudioSample`, `onStatusUpdate`, `onBatteryRamWrite`)
- **Component separation**: Each NES subsystem is a separate class with clear interfaces
- **Inheritance for mappers**: Code reuse while supporting cartridge-specific behavior
- **Frame-based execution**: 60 FPS timing with proper CPU cycle counting

### Usage Pattern
```javascript
var nes = new jsnes.NES({
  onFrame: function(frameBuffer) { /* render 256x240 pixels */ },
  onAudioSample: function(left, right) { /* play audio */ }
});
nes.loadROM(romData);
nes.frame(); // Execute one frame
nes.buttonDown(1, jsnes.Controller.BUTTON_A); // Handle input
```

## Testing

Tests use Mocha + Chai + Sinon in `test/nes.spec.js`:
- Basic initialization and ROM loading
- Frame generation with regression testing using `croom.nes` test ROM
- Frame buffer validation to ensure rendering consistency
- Error handling for invalid ROMs

Test ROMs:
- `roms/croom/` - Simple test ROM for automated testing
- `roms/AccuracyCoin/` - Comprehensive accuracy test ROM (134 tests covering CPU, PPU, APU behavior)
- `roms/nestest/` - CPU instruction test ROM (official + unofficial opcodes)
- `local-roms/` - Collection of ROMs for manual testing

AccuracyCoin test results are encoded as `(subTestNumber << 2) | 2` for failures. The test harness in `test/accuracycoin.spec.js` runs all tests and reports individual pass/fail status. Known failures are listed in the `KNOWN_FAILURES` object.

Remember that AccuracyCoin and nestest are DEFINITELY correct. They pass on a real NES. Don't blame the ROM for being wrong.

## Build Process

Webpack configuration creates UMD modules compatible with browsers and Node.js:
- Entry point: `src/index.js` (exports NES and Controller classes)
- Output: `dist/jsnes.js` (regular) and `dist/jsnes.min.js` (minified)
- Includes ESLint checking and source map generation
- Library name: `jsnes` (global variable in browsers)

## Code Quality Requirements

- All code must be formatted with Prettier (enforced by test suite)
- ESLint rules are enforced during build
- Tests must pass before commits
- Frame buffer regression tests prevent rendering regressions

## Documentation and reference for the NES

The nesdev wiki has tons of information about the NES. Browse this if you need to understand how things work, implementing a mapper, etc: https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/NES_reference_guide

## NES Hardware Accuracy

The emulator implements several hardware-accurate behaviors verified by the AccuracyCoin test ROM. 

### Open Bus

The NES data bus retains the last value from any read/write. Reading from unmapped or write-only addresses returns this "open bus" value. The CPU tracks this in `cpu.dataBus`, updated on every load, write, push, pull, opcode fetch, and interrupt vector fetch.

- **CPU open bus regions**: $4018-$5FFF (unmapped expansion), $4000-$4014 (write-only APU registers)
- **PPU open bus**: The PPU has its own internal I/O latch (`ppu.openBusLatch`), updated on every PPU register write. Write-only PPU registers ($2000, $2001, $2003, $2005, $2006) return this latch. $2002 returns status in bits 7-5 with the latch in bits 4-0.
- **Controller open bus**: $4016/$4017 only drive bits 0-4; bits 5-7 come from the CPU data bus
- **$4015 bit 5**: Not driven by APU; comes from the CPU data bus

### Dummy Reads

The 6502 performs "dummy reads" from incorrect addresses during page-crossing indexed addressing. These are real bus cycles that update the data bus and trigger I/O side effects (e.g., reading $4015 clears interrupt flags). See addressing mode cases 8, 9, 11 in `cpu.js`.

### JSR Cycle Order

The real 6502 reads JSR's target high byte *after* pushing the return address, making it the last bus operation before entering the target. This matters when JSR targets unmapped addresses — the data bus value on entry is the high byte of the target.

### APU Frame IRQ

The frame interrupt flag (`frameIrqActive`) is set unconditionally in step 4 of the 4-step frame counter sequence. The $4017 IRQ inhibit bit only prevents the IRQ from firing; the flag is still visible in $4015 bit 6. This distinction matters for tests that check $4015 while IRQs are inhibited.

## Development Notes

- The `example/` directory contains a basic web implementation but is noted as flawed compared to jsnes-web
- For web integration, prefer jsnes-web repository over the local example
- ROMs should be loaded as binary strings or byte arrays
- Timing management is the responsibility of the integrating application (60 FPS)
- Controller input uses simple button state management with 8 buttons per controller
